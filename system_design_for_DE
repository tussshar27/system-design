Questions to ask to get correct information to the interviewer and using that information, we have to design our system:
1. What will be the active user count?
Eg. there are 500000 users out of which 300000 are active users and in order to take input from all the active users our system should be SCALABLE.


2. Is there any unexpected loads?
Will there be any unexpected traffic spike in certain period of month or year.
We should be able to handle uncertain traffic load expected over the weekend or sales as well.

3. Ask to yourself, whether it will be stateless or stateful?
Stateless goes away when we refresh while Statefull does not go away.
Eg. we don't want the content of cart to be lost away after we refresh the page then that is stateful application.

4. Will it be Global or Regional?
What will be the region for website. whether it will be a multi-region website and different users will access the website from different region such as US, India, Europe, etc.
